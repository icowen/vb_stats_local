# Project Instructions

Don't run bash commands - print them, wait and let me run them

## Code Style
- Use flutter/dart for all new files
- Prefer smaller files and reusable components
- Use a consisten dark theme throughout, with shades of light neon blue or green for accents
- Dates should be formatted like YYYY-MM-DD when displayed
- Percentages should be displayed as .xxx, unless it is 1 which should be 1.xxx

## Architecture
- Database models are in lib/models/
